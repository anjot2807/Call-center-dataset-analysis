# Call-center-dataset-analysis

This repository contains a dataset and analysis of call center data. The dataset includes information about outgoing calls, such as caller ID, phone number, call type, staff ID, date, start time, handle time, total client time, abandon time, and whether the call was abandoned or not. This README file provides an overview of the dataset, its purpose, and the analysis performed.

## Dataset Description
The dataset comprises the following columns:

id: A unique identifier for each call record.

phone_num: The phone number being called.

call_type: Indicates whether the call is outgoing.

staff_id: The staff member responsible for the call.

date: The date when the call was made.

start_time: The time when the call was initiated.

handle_time: The duration of the call in seconds.

Total_Client_Time: Total time the client spent on the call in seconds.

Abandon_Time: Time before the call was abandoned (if abandoned).

abandon: A binary flag indicating whether the call was abandoned ("Y" for abandoned, "N" for not abandoned).

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to determine the optimal hours for making outgoing calls from the call center. This involves examining various aspects of the call data, including call volume, handle times, and abandonment rates, to identify time slots when call center operations are most efficient and when customer engagement is at its peak.

## Analysis

The analysis was made in the Jupyter Notebook. In this notebook, I explore the dataset, visualize key metrics, and draw insights into the best time slots for making outgoing calls. I also investigate factors contributing to call abandonment and aim to provide actionable recommendations for call center optimization.

## Conclusion
By analyzing this call center dataset, I aim to help improve call center efficiency and customer satisfaction by identifying the best hours for outgoing calls. The insights gained from this analysis can inform scheduling decisions and lead to a more effective allocation of resources within the call center.
